some linux project that uses glfw

Goals:
    - Multi-platform with linux and windows available
        + SIDE GOAL: Mac
    - Real time rasterization based rendering:
        OpenGL 4.0+ rendering
        Vulkan 1.1+ rendering
        DirectX 11  rendering
        DirectX 12  rendering
        + SIDE GOAL: Metal rendering
    - Real time ray-tracing
        Software ray-tracing
        RTX-boosted ray-tracing using VkRay or DXR
    + SIDE GOAL: Multiple windows
        This will require a window manager interface, managing focus,
        differentiating input/messages/events for each window, etc.

    - Should be as robust as possible

    This is my first foray into multiple things:
        - Vulkan
        - DX12
        - Ray-tracing

    so this will be done step-by-step focusing on creating an interface
    that can be used for all of the options that I want to have open
    first, then filling out those feature sets.

    The ray-tracing will be seperate options from rasterization.
    All DX options will be windows-only (of course)

    TOTAL OPTIONS:
        OpenGL Rasterizing
        Vulkan Rasterizing
        Vulkan Ray-tracing
        DX11 Rasterizing
        DX12 Rasterizing
        DX12 Ray-tracing

STEPS
    All options in a given section should be complete before moving to
    the next section.

	Ideally, all of the following is complete before the beginning of the semester (3rd September):
	HARD REQUIREMENT: Section 2 is complete.
	GOAL			: Section 4.
	STRETCH			: Section 5.
	
	I recently learned that GLFW can expose the native Win32 windows handle, which makes
	things MUCH easier for handling input as I no longer have to handle the difference
	between the virtual keys and GLFW keys. I needed to do this in the first place as
	creating a swap chain with DX11/12 requires a HWND.
