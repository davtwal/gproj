A vulkan toy renderer.

Goals:
    - Multi-platform with linux and windows available
        + SIDE GOAL: Mac
    - Real time ray-tracing (NEXT SEMESTER)
        Software ray-tracing
        RTX-boosted ray-tracing using VkRay or DXR

    This is my first foray into multiple things:
        - Vulkan
        - Ray-tracing

    This project is currently simply a Vulkan rastering rendering engine.

      Phong Lighting          | FINISHED
      Deferred Rendering      | FINISHED
      Hard Shadows            | FINISHED
      Hamburger 4MSM Shadows  | In Progress
      PBR                     |
